## Scalable Folder Structure

The following structure keeps the project modular and easy to scale for new contributors:

```text
SkillSphere-AI/
├── client/                          # React frontend
├── server/                          # Express backend
├── ai-ml/                           # AI/ML intelligence layer
├── docs/                            # Documentation
└── ...                              # Configuration and root files
```

## API Endpoints (Implemented)

- `GET /health`
- `POST /api/auth/register` (v2: now includes OTP verification)
- `POST /api/auth/verify-email`
- `POST /api/auth/resend-otp`
- `POST /api/auth/forgot-password`
- `POST /api/auth/reset-password`
- `POST /api/auth/login`
- `POST /api/auth/logout`
- `GET /api/auth/me`
- `POST /api/resume/upload`
- `POST /api/resume/analyze`
- `GET /api/resume/result/:id`
- `GET /uploads/:filename`

### Why this structure works

- **Feature-first design:** Easier to assign and scale work across teams
- **Clear boundaries:** Frontend, backend, and AI/ML concerns are separated
- **Contributor-friendly:** New developers can quickly find where to work
- **Future-ready:** Supports adding new learning/career modules without major rewrites

### Resume Analyzer Backend Progress

Implemented:

- Resume upload support using multer
- Resume parsing using pdf-parse
- Candidate information extraction from uploaded resumes
- Skill comparison between resume skills and job description skills
- Weighted skill score generation
- Detection of matched skills, missing skills, and extra skills
- Explainable feedback for resume vs JD matching
- MongoDB persistence for parsed resume data and skill match results
- Resume schema for storing uploaded file metadata and parsed candidate information
- GET /api/resume/result/:id endpoint to fetch stored resume records
- Reusable `ai-ml/evaluators/keywordEvaluator.js` for resume vs job description text
- Keyword relevance analysis with matched keywords, missing keywords, and weighted keyword score (`weight` default `0.2`)
- Optional `jobDescription` form field on `POST /api/resume/analyze` to run keyword evaluation alongside parsing
- Reusable `ai-ml/evaluators/experienceEvaluator.js` for resume vs job description experience matching
- Experience extraction supports years and months (examples: `18 months`, `1 year 6 months`, `2+ years`)
- Weighted experience scoring with explainable feedback (`score`, `weight`, `candidateExperience`, `requiredExperience`, `experienceGap`)
- Unit tests for experience evaluator at `ai-ml/evaluators/__tests__/experienceEvaluator.test.js`
- `/api/resume/analyze` now includes `experienceMatch` in response and MongoDB resume records

### Authentication & Security Progress

Implemented:

- OTP-based email verification using Nodemailer
- Dual-mode email service (Console logging for dev, SMTP for production)
- Secure password reset flow with enumeration protection
- 6-digit OTP generation with 5-minute expiry logic
- Brute-force protection via OTP attempt limiting (max 5 attempts)
- Reusable `sendEmail` utility for system-wide notifications
- Input validation using Zod schemas for all auth flows
- JWT-based authentication for stateful sessions
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) middleware (`student`, `tutor`, `recruiter`)
- Secure Login endpoint with credential verification
- Logout endpoint for client-side session termination
- Get Current User endpoint (`/me`) for profile fetching
- JWT verification middleware for route protection

### Frontend & Shared UI Progress

Implemented:

- Standardized State Components: `LoadingState`, `EmptyState`, `ErrorState`
- Common Page Layouts: `PageHeader` with support for gradient typography
- Barrel exports for shared components to simplify module imports
- Integration of shared states into `ResumeAnalyzerPage`
```

## For Open-Source Contributors

If you want to contribute, start by understanding:

1. Which user group your change helps (student, tutor, recruiter)
2. Which module it belongs to (classrooms, resumes, matching, interviews, dashboard)
3. Whether the change impacts frontend, backend, AI/ML, or multiple layers

This approach keeps contributions focused, reviewable, and scalable.

## Contributor Resources

- Contribution Guide: `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Code of Conduct: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- Security Policy: `SECURITY.md`
- PR Template: `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
- Issue Templates: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
- Detailed Structure Notes: `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`
- PR Quality Gates: `docs/QUALITY_GATES.md`

## PR Checks and Code Review Safety

Automated checks run on pull requests to `main` through:

- `.github/workflows/pr-quality-checks.yml`

These checks validate docs/workflows and, once app code is added, automatically run lint/test/build for `client`, `server`, and `ai-ml` when their dependency manifests exist.

## 🚀 Running the Project

### Client

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Server

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🔐 Environment Variables Setup
